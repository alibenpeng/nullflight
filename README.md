==========


This is an open source flight controller project, that runs on the Cheerson CX-10 toy quadcopter.
It can currently fly a tricopter with gyro stabilisation (3DOF). Quadcopter code is there but
untested. Autolevel code might be added later if space and time permit it.

It contains code from all over the place, so everything is subject to the respective project's license.
Everything I wrote myself is licensed under the latest GNU GPL.
